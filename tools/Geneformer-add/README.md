# Using Geneformer

All notebooks of geneformer are in the `notebooks` folder.

However to run geneformer you will need to install it following the instructions in the geneformer huggingface page.

Once this is done please replace the two files in the geneformer source code with the ones in this folder. Then you are good to go.
