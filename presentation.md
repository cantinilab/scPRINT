# icon and intro slide

# What can 50M cells teach us about gene networks? 

## Explain Gene networks

## Explain scRNAseq

## issues 

is lack of ground truth and high dimension

# Current methods

GRN inference methods, Large Cell Models claiming to map a model of the cell and doing so, can infer meaningful gene networks

LCM == ->

GENIE3 but also GNN based, other modalities, a bunch of models

train on one dataset only, need ground truth, slow to run and small networks, mostly on ODE generated fake data
